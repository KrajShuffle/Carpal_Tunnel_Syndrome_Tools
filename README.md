# Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Tools


This repository contains the documentation of an app, which collects the required measurements for a machine learning algorithm that can distinguished between carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) patients and non-CTS patients. There is also a Google Form that patients with CTS can use for identifying whether they are conducting any activities, which can progress CTS.
