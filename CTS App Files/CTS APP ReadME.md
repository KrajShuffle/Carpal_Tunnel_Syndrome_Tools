A user interested in using this app for CTS screening will initiate the process by pressing the red start circle with his/her thumb. Then, he/she will simulate a drag by dragging his/her thumb to the black target circle and press the black target circle. Upon contact, the timer will stop and reset, and its value along with the updated circle position associated with that time will be displayed on the screen. The black target circle will also move to the next counterclockwise position. This process repeats for the remaining 11 potential target circle positions. When the times for the remaining positions have been obtained, the test concludes by long pressing the black target circle to reset the timer and circle position text. The circle position and the associated tag time for each position are two key measurements that can be used for the generation of a CTS screening model.
